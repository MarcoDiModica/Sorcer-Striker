Description of the Game 
Sorcer striker is a vertical scrolling shooter launched in japan and europe on the 90’s which consists of purely destroying enemies with your spaceship, one of it’s characteristics is that every single time that a stage changes new types of enemies will appears as well as a new background and new soundtrack, it is also important to say that in the original game you could swap the element of your spaceship to deal a specific type of damage, this was implemented around the idea that the pilots are sorcerors that control the nature elements. 

Pablo did Audio, Sprites and Level Design. Jordi did some enemies and the final boss. Yiwey did gamepad implentation, FULLSCREEN mode and some polish. Alex did UI and screen implementations. Marco did enemies. coding technical things and assisting other team members.

Besides the current responsibility, each team member has worked on polishing the game and testing it.

Additional Comments
In order to implement the object class and functionality, we established a new Module, as well as a new entity. Nevertheless, although the items worked perfectly fine and as intended, some error that we have not been able to figure out does not enable the textures for the items to load. It was just this bit that did not work properly regarding the item implementation.
Having said so, we created a new enemy, with a different type of collider (implemented with the item new class) that works as a fake “enemy”.
