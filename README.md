**Description of the Game**
Sorcer striker is a vertical scrolling shooter launched in japan and europe on the 90’s which consists of purely destroying enemies with your spaceship, one of it’s characteristics is that every single time that a stage changes new types of enemies will appears as well as a new background and new soundtrack, it is also important to say that in the original game you could swap the element of your spaceship to deal a specific type of damage, this was implemented around the idea that the pilots are sorcerors that control the nature elements.
